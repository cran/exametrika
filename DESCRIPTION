Description: Implements comprehensive test data engineering methods as described in 
    Shojima (2022, ISBN:978-9811699856). Provides statistical techniques for 
    engineering and processing test data: Classical Test Theory (CTT) with 
    reliability coefficients for continuous ability assessment; Item Response 
    Theory (IRT) including Rasch, 2PL, and 3PL models with item/test information 
    functions; Latent Class Analysis (LCA) for nominal clustering; Latent Rank 
    Analysis (LRA) for ordinal clustering with automatic determination of cluster 
    numbers; Biclustering methods including infinite relational models for 
    simultaneous clustering of examinees and items without predefined cluster 
    numbers; and Bayesian Network Models (BNM) for visualizing inter-item 
    dependencies. Features local dependence analysis through LRA and biclustering, 
    parameter estimation, dimensionality assessment, and network structure 
    visualization for educational, psychological, and social science research.
